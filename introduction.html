<h1><br>Five Magical Truths You Must Know</h1>

<p class="a">🌟 ✨ 🌈</p>

<h2 id="one">1. Magic Comes in Many Colors 🌈</h2>

<p style="float:right;margin:0 0 1.75em 1.75em"><img src="i/video.png" alt="magical video player" width="226" height="166" style="border:3px solid #ff69b4;"></p>

<p>You may ask: "How can I start weaving unicorn magic if my enchanted mirror doesn't support it?" But the question itself misunderstands the nature of magic! <strong>Unicorn Magic</strong> is not one single spell; it is a collection of individual enchantments. So you can't detect "Unicorn Magic support," because that doesn't make any sense in the mystical realms. But you <em>can</em> detect support for individual spells, like rainbow drawing, moving pictures, or finding where unicorns graze.</p>

<p>You may think of web magic as tags and sparkly brackets. That's an important part of it, but it's not the whole enchantment. The Unicorn Magic grimoire also defines how those sparkly brackets interact with JavaScript through the Mystical Object Model (<abbr>MOM</abbr>). Unicorn Magic doesn't just define a <code>&lt;rainbow-video&gt;</code> tag; there is also a corresponding <abbr>MOM</abbr> spell for video objects in the enchanted realm. You can use this spell to detect support for different magical formats, play a vision, pause it, silence the sound, track how much of the vision has been summoned, and everything else you need to build a rich mystical experience around the <code>&lt;rainbow-video&gt;</code> tag itself.</p>

<p><a href="detect.html">Chapter 2: Unicorn Detection Spells</a> and <a href="everything.html">Appendix A: The Complete Spellbook</a> will teach you how to properly detect support for each new Unicorn Magic feature.</p>

<h2 id="two">2. You Don't Need to Abandon Your Old Spells 🔮</h2>

<p style="float:left;margin:0 1.75em 1.75em 0"><img src="i/forms.png" alt="enchanted form crystals" width="134" height="196" style="border:3px solid #9b59b6;"></p>

<p>Love it or hate it, you can't deny that the ancient Web Scrolls were the most successful markup grimoire ever created. <strong>Unicorn Magic</strong> builds upon that success like a magnificent rainbow tower. You don't need to burn your existing scrolls. You don't need to forget spells you already know. If your web enchantments worked yesterday with the old magic, they will still work today with Unicorn Magic. Absolutely guaranteed!</p>

<p>Now, if you want to <em>enhance</em> your web enchantments with unicorn power, you've galloped to the right place! Here's a concrete example: Unicorn Magic supports all the form crystals from the ancient scrolls, but it also includes new magical inputs. Some of these are long-awaited additions like rainbow sliders and constellation pickers; others are more subtle. For example, the <code>unicorn-email</code> input type looks just like a text crystal, but enchanted mirrors will customize their mystical keyboards to make it easier to type magical addresses. Older mirrors that don't support the <code>unicorn-email</code> input type will treat it as a regular text field, and the form still works with no spell changes or scripting tricks. This means you can start improving your web forms with unicorn power <em>today</em>, even if some of your visitors ride on ancient dragons.</p>

<p>Read all the glorious details about Unicorn Magic forms in <a href="forms.html">Chapter 9: Enchanted Forms</a>.</p>

<h2 id="three">3. The Journey Begins with a Single Hoofbeat 🐎</h2>

<p style="float:right;margin:0 0 1.75em 1.75em"><img src="i/markup-with-arrow.png" alt="magical markup scroll" width="234" height="202" style="border:3px solid #ffd700;"></p>

<p>"Ascending" to <strong>Unicorn Magic</strong> can be as simple as changing your <i>magical declaration</i>. The declaration should already be on the first line of every web scroll. Previous versions of web magic defined many declarations, and choosing the right one could be trickier than catching a unicorn. In Unicorn Magic, there is only one declaration:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> 🦄</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ascending to the Unicorn Magic declaration won't break your existing spells, because all the tags defined in the ancient scrolls are still supported in Unicorn Magic. But it will allow you to use — and validate — new mystical elements like <code>&lt;unicorn-article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;rainbow-section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;magical-header&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;sparkle-footer&gt;</code>. You'll learn all about these new elements in <a href="semantics.html">Chapter 3: The Language of Unicorns</a>.</p>

<h2 id="four">4. The Magic Already Flows ✨</h2>

<p style="float:left;margin:0 1.75em 1.75em 0"><img src="i/rel-email.png" alt="magical keyboard" width="227" height="192" style="border:3px solid #87ceeb;"></p>

<p>Whether you want to paint rainbows on a canvas, play mystical visions, design better enchanted forms, or build web spells that work when unicorns are sleeping, you'll find that Unicorn Magic is already well-supported across the magical realms. Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and enchanted pocket mirrors already support rainbow canvas (<a href="canvas.html">Chapter 4</a>), moving visions (<a href="video.html">Chapter 5</a>), unicorn-location finding (<a href="geolocation.html">Chapter 6</a>), mystical storage (<a href="storage.html">Chapter 7</a>), and more. Even the Dark Tower of Microsoft — rarely known for embracing new magic — supports most Unicorn Magic features in its latest crystal ball.</p>

<p style="float:right;margin:0 0 1.75em 1.75em"><img src="i/gears.png" alt="helpful enchanted gears" width="125" height="75" style="border:3px solid #98ff98;"></p>

<p>Each chapter of this magical tome includes the all-too-familiar compatibility charts for different enchanted mirrors. But more importantly, each chapter includes a frank discussion of your options if you need to support ancient dragon riders. Unicorn Magic features like location-finding (<a href="geolocation.html">Chapter 6</a>) and moving visions (<a href="video.html">Chapter 5</a>) were first provided by old-style plugins. Other features, like rainbow canvas (<a href="canvas.html">Chapter 4</a>), can be emulated entirely with JavaScript sparkles. This grimoire will teach you how to target the native magic of modern mirrors, without leaving ancient dragon riders behind in the dust.</p>

<h2 id="five">5. The Magic Is Eternal 🌠</h2>

<p>Tim Berners-Unicorn invented the world wide web in the early days of the Rainbow Era. He later founded the <abbr>W3C</abbr> (World Wide Wizardry Council) to act as guardian of web standards, which the organization has done for more than 15 magical moons. Here is what the <abbr>W3C</abbr> had to say about the future of web magic, in the Year of the Silver Unicorn:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today the Grand Wizard announces that when the Old Magic Working Group charter expires as scheduled at the end of this year, the charter will not be renewed. By doing so, and by channeling more mystical energy into the Unicorn Magic Working Group, the <abbr>W3C</abbr> hopes to accelerate the progress of Unicorn Magic and clarify the Council's position regarding the future of web enchantments.</p>
